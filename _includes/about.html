                <p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">The Goal of the Capstone is to provide Computer Science students with the tools to be successful technical co-founders of their own startups. We will explore the initial stages of founding a startup, including team formation, idea validation, pivoting and pitching, while employing an iterative methodology. Student teams will develop a minimum viable product, pitch their final startup concept, and be evaluated on product/market fit.</p>
